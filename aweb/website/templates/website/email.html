            <p>In the summer of 2018, I was offered an opportunity to hone my software development and data visualization skills at NYC DOHMH. I worked with the Data Analytics Team of School Health (NYC DOHMH) as a Software and Data Visualization Consultant to perform data analysis on the various datasets from the NYC School Health database and to create data visualization tools, which possess the capability to generate automated charts from the data using R scripts. In the past, the charts were created manually in excel, which was really time-consuming as they need to produce hundreds of charts. With the help of the scripts, these charts can be produced in a matter of seconds.

            <p>I have worked in multiple web app based projects with Dr. Eugene Callahan (NYU). As a mentor, he has helped me hone my skills in multiple programming languages and apply those adopted skills to produce fully functional web apps and manage their databases (SQLite, MySQL). I have worked on and assisted in developing a bibliography search engine for the undergrad and grad student at NYU Tandon. My task entailed developing, modifying and maintaining frontend and backend of the web-app and the database. I am also currently working on setting up multiple automated testing procedures for the web-app. We use Git to collaborate and to manage the code. All the changes to projects are pushed to GitHub repositories regularly. We also use Docker containers and shell scripts to expedite our work.

            My penchant for sorting, pattern detection, and correlational modeling eventually came in handy for the intricate and relevant research that I later started with Dr. Elizabeth Zollinger on Breast Cancer. We presented a mathematical, compartmental model of breast cancer and evaluated it computationally in R and MATLAB. There are five cell populations:  cancer stem cells, tumor cells, and activated T-cells (immune cells), TGF-b (immune-regulatory protein, B), and regulatory T cells (R) within the tumor compartment. The interactions between these cell populations are represented by a system of differential equations. We use data measuring the growth of a tumor from a previous study to fit parameters to our model, analyze the sensitivity and investigate the interactions among the different cell populations.

              <p>
                 I improved the accuracy of our model by fitting the parameters of the differential equations (using fminsearch and optim function) to data points from an already established study so that the system best describes the growth of the various cells. Once the parameters are determined, we examined the dynamics within the tumor between the cell populations to provide a treatment through immunotherapy. All the results are displayed through the plotting of graphs based on the differential equations.

                      I recently got accepted to a three week Deep Learning summer program at the highly reputable Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Tsinghua University is one of the top universities in the world. According to the U.S. News ranking, it is the number one university for Computer Science and Engineering. The program has a mere 6% acceptance rate. Each year the program selects only 25 students out of the hundreds who apply from different parts of the world.
                      The program had a rigorous schedule each day that featured multiple lectures by renowned professors of the machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence field, deep learning labs, and group research projects. I effectively honed my deep learning skills by actively participating in each aspect of the program.

I, alongside my colleagues, have made SJC<sup>2</sup> a safe haven for all computer and technology aficionados. Every year we bring in speakers from renowned tech companies, like, Google, NBC, Goldman Sachs, Viber, and more to contribute their knowledge and experience to our students. Moreover, we facilitate students to go on field trips to companies like, Google, NBC, Fueled etc. so that the students can get exposure to different tech-industry environments. We also conduct workshops on Python, Java, Git, and VIM for computer majors, in order to provide them with learning experience outside of the classroom.
